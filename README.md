# Recipe Search API with React.js - [Link here](https://recipesearch-api.web.app)

### The goal of this project is to practice React.js and asynchronous API fetching after learning the theory.

#### The API of this website is from edamam.com, which includes over 2.3 million recipes across the world.

#### I was able to solidify my understanding with:

> - React.js Hooks (State/Effect)
> - Asynchronous API calls (async/await)
> - JSX (JavaScript XML)
> - React props and components
> - CSS modules
